# MajorPrivacy
Major Privacy is an advanced privacy tool for windows, it is a continuation of the [PrivateWin10](https://github.com/DavidXanatos/priv10) project, it brings a multitude of new functionality made possible through the use of a custom kernel isolation driver. Conceptually Major Privacy is a HIPS, the driver can monitor/filter, file/registry access as well as protect processes from being manipulated by other processes. It leverages the windows built in mechanisms to restrict network traffic and brings a convenient collection of privacy enhancing tweaks. It implements an own rule-based software restriction mechanism, i.e. the ability to prevent unauthorized or undesired applications from running. Using the process protection feature of the KernelIsolator driver Major Privacy can protect unprivileged user processes from being compromised and their secrets exfiltrated, even from threads running with system or administrative privileges. The ability to protect processes in combination with its ability to restrict access to files and folders helps to protect personal data. Furthermore, Major Privacy is capable of creating protected volumes located in encrypted container files, such that access to confidential data is only possible when the user provided the correct password and the tool is actively filtering filesystem accesses. The privacy agent logs file, registry and network access and provides comprehensive logs and visualizations of process activity on the host system, enabling the users to check if their applications are only doing what they want them to do. Major Privacy is designed to not only provide a line of defense against regular malware but also defend the user from legitimate but overreaching software, such that the software can be safely used and the companies behind it won‚Äôt be able to access anything the user did not choose to make available.

## ü§ù Licensing 
This tool is open source; however, the license is a bit more restrictive than typical open source licenses. 
MajorPrivacy is free like in freedom not like in free beer, meaning if you are using it you are expected to get a license from xanasoft.com, the UI will remind you of that from time to time.
If you want to publicly distribute self-compiled binaries review the LICENSE file for details.
